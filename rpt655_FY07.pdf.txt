REPORT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE PURSUANT TO SECTION 655 OF THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961, AS AMENDED
Direct Commercial Sales Export Authorizations for Fiscal Year 2007
Overview
This report covers defense articles and defense services licensed for permanent export during Fiscal Year 2007 under Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended (AECA). It is provided pursuant to Section 655 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. The report is obligated to show the aggregate dollar value and quantity of defense articles and defense services, by category, authorized to each foreign country, including any international organizations operating in each country.
The formatting changed in FY 2007 due to the transition from paper licenses to electronic licenses midway through the reporting timeframe. The services, or agreements, segment of D-Trade is not yet operational and therefore no changes were made to that part of the report.
In accordance with Section 655(c), this report is also being made available to the public on the Internet through the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, at www.pmddtc.state.gov.
Part 1 of the report details approximately $24.5 billion in licenses authorizing the permanent export of defense articles by country, including any international organizations operating in that country, quantity, value, and U.S. Munitions List (USML) Category and Subcategory.
Part 2 of the report details approximately $64.2 billion in defense services (i.e., agreements) authorized for export by country including any international organizations operating in that country, value, and USML Category.
Authorizations applicable to multiple countries are included under the designation “Various” in Parts 1 and 2. Importantly, the value of authorizations provided under Section 38 for defense articles and defense services does not precisely correlate to the value of articles actually transferred during this same time frame. Most licenses issued for articles shown in Part 1 are valid for four years and may be used throughout the period of validity to carry out the authorized export

transactions. Similarly, manufacturing license and technical assistance agreements set forth in Part 2 of the report cover a wide range of programmatic activities for multi-year periods (generally exceeding the four-year validity period of defense article export licenses). Because the scope of the Department’s regulatory authority over such agreements continues for as long as these multi-year agreements remain in effect, export authorizations furnished in Fiscal Year 2007 relate to previously-approved agreements that were subsequently modified. Therefore, such authorizations may relate to activities occurring in prior years.
