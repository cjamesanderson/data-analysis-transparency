REPORT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE PURSUANT TO SECTION 655 OF THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961, AS AMENDED Direct Commercial Sales Authorizations for Fiscal Year 2008
Overview
This report covers defense articles and defense services licensed for permanent export during Fiscal Year 2008 under Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended. It is provided pursuant to Section 655 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. The report specifies the aggregate dollar value and quantity of defense articles and defense services, by category, authorized to each foreign country, including any international organizations operating in each country, as well as data on the actual shipments occurring during the Fiscal Year. Actual shipment data contained herein shows the total dollar value of all shipments to each destination. Authorizations in this report are categorized based on the destination country licensed. This includes articles exported for use by U.S. Government agencies within the country of export as well as articles exported for use by U.S. and Allied forces operating on foreign soil.
In accordance with subsection (c) of Section 655, this report is also being made available to the public on the Internet through the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, at www.pmddtc.state.gov.
Part 1 of the report details approximately $34.2 billion in licenses authorizing the permanent export of defense articles by country, including any international organizations operating in that country, quantity, value, and USML Category and Sub Category.
Part 2 of the report details approximately $71.3 billion in defense services (i.e., agreements) authorized for export by country including any international organizations operating in that country, value, and USML Category.
Authorizations applicable to multiple countries are included under the designation “Various” in Parts 1 and 2. Since documentation for shipping purposes requires a definitive destination be declared, actual shipments for those articles approved under the designation “Various” are attributed to the country listed on the shipping
________________
documentation. Actual shipments for articles approved for the United Nations are attributed to the country in which the UN will utilize the items.
Importantly, the value of authorizations provided under Section 38 for defense articles and defense services does not precisely correlate to the value of articles actually transferred during this same time frame. Most licenses issued for articles shown in Part 1 are valid for four years and may be used throughout the period of validity to carry out the authorized export transactions. Similarly, manufacturing license and technical assistance agreements set forth in Part 2 of the report cover a wide range of programmatic activities for multi-year periods (generally exceeding the four-year validity period of defense article export licenses). Because the scope of the Department’s regulatory authority over such agreements continues for as long as these multi-year agreements remain in effect, export authorizations furnished in Fiscal Year 2008 also include certain activities occurring in prior years.
